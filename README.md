# Sales-Forcasting-with-Linear-Regression
This project demonstrates the application of linear regression in forecasting sales, providing a valuable tool for businesses to anticipate future sales and make informed decisions.

Project Overview:
This project involves developing a linear regression model to forecast future sales based on historical sales data. The model aims to provide accurate sales predictions to aid in business decision-making and planning.

Key Features:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis, handling missing values and outliers.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted EDA to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships in the sales data.
Feature Engineering: Created new features to improve the model's predictive power.
Model Building: Developed a linear regression model to predict future sales.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as R-squared and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
Visualization: Visualized the results with plots to provide insights into the model's predictions and accuracy.

Technologies Used:

Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn
